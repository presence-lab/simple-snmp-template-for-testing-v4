"""Audit capture-layer integrity by comparing file hashes against INTEGRITY_HASHES.txt.

There are two tiers of tracking:

- TRACKED files have their content hashes pinned. Any modification, even
  whitespace, is reported as MODIFIED. These are course-infrastructure
  files students should never edit.
- SOFT_TRACKED files are checked only for presence and non-emptiness; the
  content is expected to be student-edited. Used for files like
  `.ai-traces/external-attestation.txt` where deletion or wholesale
  emptying is the signal we care about, not content changes.

Usage:
    python tools/verify_integrity.py            # check current file hashes
    python tools/verify_integrity.py --update   # regenerate INTEGRITY_HASHES.txt
                                                # (instructor use only, after
                                                # intentional capture changes)

Exit code 0 on match, 1 on mismatch / soft-track violation, 2 on missing
hard-tracked file or missing INTEGRITY_HASHES.txt.
